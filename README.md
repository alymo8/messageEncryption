# Message Encryption
 
This project can encrypt files with a 30 character key, using the Fernet library. The program takes the path of the input file, asks for user input to see if the file needs to be encrypted or decrypted. Then it does the requested command, by creating a new encrypted/decrypted file named by the user. It asks the user for input at all stages of the program. Here is a video showing how the program works:
